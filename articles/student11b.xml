            <p>Bell typically gets recognized for the "Bell Scandal of 2010," in which elected city officials abused their power and misappropriated the city’s funds in order to pay themselves incredibly high salaries. The council at the time was predominantly Latino. Although people believed that having a council of the same ethnicity would help better circumstances in the city, it is evident that they were wrong. The Bell Scandal reinforces the idea of the city as a “city of extraction,” where the primary economic activity of the city is extracting what little wealth remains. The city demographics have a lot to do with allowing this abuse of power to occur. Many of the citizens have little education and are not too active politically, due to fear brought on by immigration status, allowinng corrupted city officials to take advantage of small cities like Bell.</p>
