            <p>Maywood Park is a historical site in the city. It is a place for the children to go and exercise in a safe environment. The park began as a meadow in the 1930’s but was later converted into a baseball field due to the high demand for recreational activates by Maywood residents. By the time the 1950’s came along, this park became home of the Golden State Baseball Association. Eighty years later, this park still stand through community efforts, allowing its residents to have a place where they can have a large open space. The location of Maywood Park offers a wide variety of exercise opportunities such as a Southeast Rio Vista YMCA. The YMCA offers many youth programs and is also very affordable, providing flexible payment plans. Maywood Park and the YMCA are important community resources that help keep kids off the streets and live better and active lives.</p>
