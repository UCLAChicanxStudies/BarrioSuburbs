            <p>The James George Bell House is a Historic Landmark for the city of Bell and is located on the intersection between Gage Avenue and Pine Avenue, right next to the city library. The house is the original house of James George Bell, the founder of the city. The Bell house was moved from its original location to the location it is in now and was restored after the move so that it could be preserved. The house was converted into a museum for the history of Bell. Although this house holds much significance value for the city it is not recognized as a historic landmark as far as the federal government is concerned.</p>
