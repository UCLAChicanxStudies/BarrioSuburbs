            <p>With a large Hispanic population still in tune with their cultural roots, many Maywood residents are inherently Catholic. St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church offers services and mass to anyone willing to experience the Word of God. Saint Roseâ€™s purpose is to extend the knowledge of Christ in the community through all facets of Catholic values. It was founded in the year 1922, though it began as a small parish, it was soon expanded and improved through the generous donations it has received over the years. St. Rose of Lima offers sermons in both English and Spanish, taking into the account that many Maywood residents like to hear their sermons in their native language. This parish offers many programs for youth development and youth groups and of course, all are welcome. St. Rose is a true testament of a divinity within the community.</p>
