            <p>Classified as one of the first suburbs to exist in the outskirts of the Los Angeles area, Lincoln Heights is a traditional region that holds notable and conserved history of its beginning and current identification as a suburb. Lincoln Heights represented the ideal suburban utopia of the early eighteenth century Angeleno with homes that were in traditional Victorian architecture, wide and open spaces for parks and lakes, and various leisure activities located through out the neighborhood. Through out the years this community has continued forth as a suburb, but has been constantly reshaped by various groups that include through Chican@ and Latin@ urbanism. It is evident to see the repetitive historical cycle of rotating cultural communities that start to live in suburbs closer to the city while previous residents take flight to other areas. Overall, racial and cultural factors continue to compile and keep Lincoln Heights alive. </p>
