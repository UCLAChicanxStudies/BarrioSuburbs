            <p>The Maywood Towne Center is synonymous to the types of centrally located plazas found in California’s early Colonias. Like the Colonias, many of Maywood’s most prominent buildings and businesses are located in the center of town. This Colonia type of influence allows the expansion of the town outward and places an emphasize on businesses in the center. This makes them more assessable to the town’s population. Maywood is already one of the smaller suburbs in Los Angeles and having a centralized town center makes trips to the market, library or church conveniently close. With everything within walking distance for Maywood residents, there is not a location in town that is more than a ten-to-fifteen-minute walk. This is advantageous when wanting to avoid bad Los Angeles traffic and also a great way to get some daily exercise.</p>
