            <p>Highland Park is located in the Northeast L.A. region, surrounded by similar Latino suburbs and other affluent neighborhoods. Its built environment consists of various recreational centers, popular main streets, historic buildings and easy access to transportation (i.e. Pasadena Freeway).  Highland Park began as a predominantly white neighborhood with a small amount of minorities segregated into underdeveloped spaces. Over time, it has evolved into a predominantly Latino suburb with 74 percent of its residents being of Latino origin. Its close proximity to Downtown Los Angeles also offers an escape from city life and allows Highland Parkâ€™s Latino community to preserve a space that reflects their values and cultures; the ability to commute helps maintain a connection with job sites and other Latino communities. The spatial transformation of this Latino enclave faces a challenge on preserving Latino culture and welcoming different racial groups to the spaces that Latinos struggled to gain access to.</p>
