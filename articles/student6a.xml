            <p>Beginning in 1970, the collapse of industrial manufacturing in Southern California acted as a catalyst for the large influx of Latinos into Huntington Park and surrounding neighborhoods and suburbs. By the 1970s, many white middle class residents left the area because they were overqualified for the growing number of low-skilled service jobs in Southeast LA. This availability of housing and semi-skilled labor vacuum facilitated a large influx of Latinos mainly from Mexico to settle in Huntington Park. The ethnic succession of this community is strongly linked to changing local economic factors. Currently, the city is nearly 100% Latino and much denser than previous decades. The shops on the main thoroughfare of Pacific Blvd. are evidence of this shift in demographics with more stores that cater to the Latino community's needs.
