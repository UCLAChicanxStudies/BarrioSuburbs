            <p>Santa Ana, California is a working class suburb situated within middle and upper class suburbs in Orange County. The city is mainly comprised of people from a Latino background, the majority of Mexican decent. Its residents work blue-collar jobs and reside within the high density suburb. Santa Ana, like many other places in the citrus belt, experienced segregation in the first part of the 20th century, particularity residents from a Mexican background. Presently, Santa Ana’s Downtown and its border neighborhoods have experienced increased investment, resulting in new homes being built and the diversifying of the local population. In the last twenty years, “Santa Ana became one of the ten cities with the highest percentage of Latinos in the Unites States” (Guzman). Situated between white suburbia in Orange County, Chicano urbanism created a new major barrio, with over 350,000 Latinos.</p>
