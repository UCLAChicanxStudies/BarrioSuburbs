            <p>Located in the abandoned Lincoln Heights Jail, the Bilingual Foundation of Arts was established in 1973 by Mexican-American actress Carmen Zapata and director Margarita Galban (BFA). Due to the lack of Latin#064;s in Hollywood and other spheres of entertainment, the founders centered their nonprofit organization with the mission to create a recognized space for productions of Spanish-language masterworks and contemporary plays by Latin American writers. The Bilingual Foundation of Arts also opened an opportunity for Latin#064;s to venture into the world of the arts through theater related professions such as directing, acting, scriptwriting, and set designing (Woo). Thus, the organization became a success and is still warmly active. After 38 years of being located in Lincoln Heights, the BFA has moved into a new location due to the facility dubbed as unsafe by the cityâ€™s fire department (Garcia). The theater house currently resides in Downtown L.A.</p>
