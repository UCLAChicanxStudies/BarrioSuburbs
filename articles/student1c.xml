            <p>Historic 1889 Boyle Hotel-Cummings Block can be found at the corner of North Boyle Avenue and East First Street. Its Queen Anne style can be credited to architect William R. Norton, who was hired by George Cummings and Sacramenta Cummings to design the four-story building. During this time the hotel became a popular residential and commercial establishment. This is because it was built along the tracks of an adjacent streetcar that connected downtown to First Street. Due to this railroad connection, moving to the outer city became more affordable and accessible. Later in the twentieth century it became known as “Mariachi Hotel” because it housed a majority of Mariachi musicians who worked across the hotel at Mariachi Plaza. Because it is a significant architectural and historical monument that preserves the past history of Boyle Heights, it became Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument # 891 on October 24, 2007.  </p>
