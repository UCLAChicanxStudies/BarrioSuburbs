                <p>Prior to becoming a Latino suburb, Highland Park was historically a white residential area with occupations, such as skilled artisans, white-collar workers and small business and professional men. The Highland Park Masonic Temple is a historical two-story building, which is now home to L.A. City Councilmember Gil Cedilloâ€™s District Office and two other businesses; along with these businesses/office, the second floor is available for banquets and special events. However, this historic building was a meeting space for freemasons and their fraternal organization, which exemplifies the artisan occupations held by early residents of Highland Park. Today, the preservation of the Masonic Temple has opened a space for Latino politician, Gil Cedillo, to establish his district office and closely engage with the predominantly Latino community. Over time, ethnic succession became visible in demographics and the use of public spaces changed accordingly to the Latino suburb that was rapidly growing in Highland Park.  </p>
