            <p>This picture depicts the size of the city of Bell. Although considered one of the smallest cities in California, it is also one of the most highly populated. Bell is approximately 2.55 square miles large with roughly 14,357 people per square mile and 90.7% of the total population is Latino. The city of Bell is typically left off of maps; when looking for it on google maps, you must zoom in three times before it is visible. This implies that this city is not seen with much significance. It is typically over looked and not many people have heard of it or even know it exists if they are not from the area. The fact that Bell is left off of maps and is hard to find exemplifies the idea that maps are used as tools of power to segregate and neglect people of minorities- in this case particularly Latino/as.</p>
