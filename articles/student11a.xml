            <p>This picture depicts the size of the city of Bell so that people can see just how small the city is; it is considered one of the smallest cities in California and it is also one of the most highly populated. It is primarily composed of Hispanic residents. The city of Bell is typically left off of maps and when looking for it on google maps you must zoom in three times before it is visible. This infers that this city is not seen with much significance. It is typically over looked and not many people have heard of it or even know it exists if they are not from the area. The fact that this city is left off of maps and is hard to find exemplifies the idea that maps are used as tools of power to segregate and neglect people of minorities- in this case particularly Latino/as.</p>
