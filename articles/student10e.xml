            <p>The Madison Exercise Park (Bike Trail) is a 6 mile trail that runs through the heart of Santa Ana. The trail’s entry point begins in Downtown Santa Ana and connects with the Santa Ana River in the southwest part of the city. The City of Santa Ana is a high-density city that lacks green spaces (Guzman 2001). Normal perceptions of the path may entail an ordinary trail, however, the community has changed the space. The trail serves as a gathering area where residents can escape traffic congestion and obtain a healthier life style. Throughout the day, many residents utilize this trail. For children, it serves as their daily route to school, joggers use the path for running, and families utilize it as a picnic area. Presently, the city has been working hard to increase park space for the Santa Ana residents. The Bike Trail provides the communities with the ability to self-represent and forms both a social and procedural change of what a space is defined as (Parker 477).</p>
