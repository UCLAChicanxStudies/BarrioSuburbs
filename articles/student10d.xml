            <p>The Yost Theater is a Historic Landmark in Santa Ana and is the oldest theater in Orange County. The Yost first opened its doors in 1913 when it was known as The Auditorium. In the same year, it was renamed The Clunes. It was not until Ed Yost purchased the theater in 1919 that the name was changed again. Today, it still holds the same name, The Yost Theater. In the 1950s, the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema was at its peak.
