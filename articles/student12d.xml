            <p>The Bowers Museum opened its doors in 1936 through the philanthropy of Santa Ana residents Charles and Ada Bowers. It is located on North Main Street and is Orange County’s largest museum. It closed from 1986 to 1992 and when it reopened it was to address the community's needs as a cultural center. In 1994, it opened a children’s program, the Kidseum. In 2007, it expanded with the construction of the Dorothy and Donald Kennedy Wing. The museum offers exhibitions, lectures, art classes, travel programs, and children's art education programs. From December 12, 2015 through May 29, 2016, it is exhibiting the Popol Vuh: Watercolors of Diego Rivera, who in 1931 created a collection of watercolor works illustrating the sacred Mayan book. It is the home to exhibitions including the First Californians, California Legacies: Missions and Ranchos (1768-1848), and the Ceramics of Western Mexico. Also located on North Main Street. The Discovery Science Foundation’s DiscoveryCube of Orange County opened its doors to the community and public in 1991. It is a non-profit organization thats missions is to educate the minds of children and guide them in STEM fields.</p>
