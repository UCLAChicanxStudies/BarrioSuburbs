            <p>Since the city of Maywood has a Hispanic population that exceeds 95% of its 27000+ residents, it makes sense that their city officials are comprised of Hispanic or people of Hispanic descent. These councilmembers are elected by the residents of Maywood and for the residents of Maywood. They are seen throughout the community and can be reached by email and in their respected visiting times. These are the leaders of the community of Maywood who want to put the people first and improve the community as a whole. It is envisioned by the people of Maywood, the mayor and the councilmembers that by the 2018, Maywood will become a “model community where families, young professionals and businesses thrive.” Through active political participation, and bimonthly agenda meetings, this can be accomplished by Maywood residents. It is their voice that is heard and the people’s voice is often the loudest.</p>
