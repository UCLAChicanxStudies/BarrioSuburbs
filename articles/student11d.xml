            <p>Bell High School is the only high school left in the LAUSD school district that is still operating on a year round, track system calendar. The student population is so great in Bell that it cannot afford to accommodate all of its students on a traditional school year calendar. In the past, Bell sent students to different schools on buses before Maywood Academy High School opened up in an effort to alleviate Bell High Schoolâ€™s overcrowding issue. Bell High School is primarily composed of Hispanic students and falls below the state average in ELA and Math Proficiency. Classrooms are filled to their maximum with about 32 students to every one teacher, making it difficult for students who need a little extra help to get the attention they need from their teacher.</p>

            <p>Bell High School is the last school in LAUSD to run on a track system due to the dense population of the city and high number of teenagers.</p>
