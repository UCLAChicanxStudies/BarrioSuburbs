            <p>The Bell Community Center serves many purposes in the community but one of their most artistic is the mural that they helped bring to the community. The name of the mural is unknown; however, it was commissioned by a group known as “Latino Barrio Roots” who is involved with the Los Angeles Mexican Consulate. The idea of the mural was brought to the city of Bell as a way to help divert the attention of citizens who suffered from drug and alcohol problems and provide them with an alternative escape. There are many aspects of the portrait whose meaning is unclear but the overall message and reason behind the mural is to empower the Latino/a community. Bell was strategically selected because of its high Latino/a population and community pride in being of Latin descent.</p>
