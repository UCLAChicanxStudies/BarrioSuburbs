            <p>Santa Ana College opened its doors in fall of 1915 on Santa Ana High School’s campus. Santa Ana College is the second junior college founded in Orange County and the fourth oldest in California. In 1933, because of a devastating earthquake, its location moved to North Main Street. In 1945, a bond measure passed to relocate to 17th Street and Bristol. In 1971, Santa Ana College formed the Rancho Santiago Community College District, separating from the Santa Ana Unified School District. Santa Ana College is ranked as one of the nation’s top two-year colleges awarding associate degrees to Latino and Asian students. The college offers a School of Continuing Education that allows the community and public to pursue adult education to obtain General Education Diplomas, Adult High School Program, English as a Second Language, Adult Basic Education, Career Technical Education, and Inmate Program. This program is available at the Centennial Education Center on West Edinger. In the 2013-2014 academic year, the total enrolled population was 66,443 which of 39,179 are Hispanic. In that year, 676 students transferred to California State Universities and 101 into the Universities of California.</p>
