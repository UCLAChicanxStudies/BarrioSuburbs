            <p>Boyle Heights is currently a densely populated Mexican-American neighborhood in East Los Angeles. Historically it has functioned as an immigrant gateway due to the availability of industry-related jobs, and immigrant exclusion from middle-class Anglo communities on the west side. By the late 1930s Boyle Heights consequently became a haven for diverse ethnic groups. This included Jews, Mexicans, Japanese, Italians, Armenians, African Americans, and Russians. Given their exclusion, Boyle Heights became a site of multiracial organizing. Then, after World War II a population boom led to overcrowding. Contributing factors included the return of World War II veterans and Japanese Americans from internment camps, as well as the influx of Mexican Braceros. In search of better housing, Euro-Americans eventually out-migrated to the west side causing the Eastside to become predominantly Mexican-American. In spite of this, Boyle Height’s multiracial roots prove to be an important part of the rich Mexican-American culture that characterizes it today.</p>
