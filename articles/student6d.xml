            <p>Ulysses Romero founded Tierra Mia Coffee in 2008. The coffee shop specializes in Latino-inspired flavors. Their signature drink is their Horchata Latte. Unlike other specialty coffee businesses that established themselves in white middle to higher income neighborhoods, Romero wanted to serve the growing community of Latinos in LA. His stores have been strategically placed in lower and working class neighborhoods where there are also large numbers of Latinos. The stores serve as community gathering places for families and friends in traditionally underserved parts of LA. Recently, Romero launched his own foundation, “Tierra Mia Cares,” which attempts to improve early childhood literacy with nearby schools. This business model is an example of the growing Latino middle class as a source of capital. Romero proves that it is possible to run both a successful and socially-conscious business within the socio-economically diverse Latino community in LA.</p>
