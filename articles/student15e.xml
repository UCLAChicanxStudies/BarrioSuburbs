            <p>Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church is located south of downtown Ontario and it is one of the main churches that caters towards the Ontario Latino community. Its humble structure and environment make it easier for Latinos to connect. Although there are many other catholic churches in the area, this church is particularly important due to its proximity to where the Sunkist packing house once stood. This shows that the Latino community settled close to where the job sources stood, however, they also made an effort to make this places more comfortable and resourceful for them.</p>
