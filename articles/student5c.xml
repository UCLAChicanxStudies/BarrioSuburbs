            <p>The Maywood library was established in 1921, it was named, the Maywood Free Public Library at the time. It started out as a free public space for learning in early 20th century. It continues this tradition as it offers many afterschool programs to promote youth growth and even adult educational programs. By 1993 Maywood’s city council changed the name of the library to honor César Chávez, so now it is called the Maywood César Chávez Library. Since much of the population in Maywood is Hispanic, the library offers a large variety of books in Spanish for children and adults. Children and teens are encouraged to come for assistant in schoolwork as they offer homework help. This adds to the idea that learning should begin at a young age and is something that should never stop. Along with this, it offers free wifi and access to public computers.  </p>
