            <p>The Sixth Street Viaduct, better known as the 6th Street Bridge, was developed in 1932. It is approximately 3, 500 feet in length and spans the Los Angeles River, the Santa Ana freeway, various railroad tracks, as well as local streets. Due to its enormous size, the bridge has been noted as an outstanding engineering accomplishment. The 6th Street Bridge has been widely popularized due to its appearances in films such as “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” as well as “Grease.” However, it is also a Historic-Cultural Monument. This bridge is of great importance to Boyle Heights because it is the mechanism by which people have been able to reach downtown Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the bridge is currently in the process of being replaced as a result of seismic vulnerability. A new bridge is expected to be completed by 2019 and will cost approximately $449 million. </p>
