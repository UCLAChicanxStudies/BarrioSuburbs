            <p>John and Elizabeth Hollenbeck are recognized for their heavy real estate investment in Los Angeles during the 1800s, which included the first home development for the aged in Boyle Heights. What makes this place unique and of historical importance to Boyle Heights is that this home housed over eight different nationalities and religious faiths during a period in history, in which high racial tensions and intolerance existed. Furthermore, while the developers also intended for the facility to be free, after the death of Elizabeth Hollenbeck in 1918, the place faced investment losses due to the Great Depression, and this led to the new admission of elderly patients that came with assets. Therefore, this home is unique to the Latino community as it serves as the first elderly home in Boyle Heights to allow various ethnicities to coexist and that served the low income community versus the Anglo community.</p>
